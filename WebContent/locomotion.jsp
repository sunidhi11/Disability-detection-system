   <h3> Rh Factor Test</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-8">
    <h4>Pregnant women who have Rh negative blood type can be treated to prevent problems with blood
     incompatibility with their infant while in the womb. All pregnant women are tested to determine 
     their blood type. If a woman is found to be Rh negative, she can be immunized early in pregnancy 
     and again within 72 hours of giving birth (or after the pregnancy terminates) to help reduce the 
     risk of blood incompatibility during current or future pregnancies. Rh blood incompatibility 
     can be a contributing factor to development of CP.  If the woman who is Rh negative has developed 
     an incompatibility with a baby’s blood, various treatments can be used during and after pregnancy 
     to optimize the baby’s health reducing the risk of CP for that child.</h4>

   <h3>Prenatal Care</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-8">
  <h4>It is important for women to get proper health care prior to conception, to be evaluated by a high-risk
   perinatologist if they anticipate pregnancy complications, and to have early and continuous prenatal care 
   throughout the pregnancy. Prematurity (being born too soon) may result in brain injury and subsequent CP. 
   The following steps can help prevent premature births:

Reducing exposure of pregnant women to virus and other infections
Recognizing and treating bacterial infection of the reproductive and urinary tracts
Avoiding unnecessary exposure to X-rays, drugs, alcohol, cigarettes and medications
Controlling maternal health problems such as diabetes, anemia and hypertension
Optimal maternal nutrition including maternal vitamin supplements
Ensuring optimal evaluation for women who have had miscarriages or prior premature infants. In some cases, treatments can be offered to reduce  risk of recurrence (e.g. hydroxyprogesterone treatment in women with high risk of premature delivery, treatments for cervical incompetence or uterine malformations)</h4>

   <h3>Treating Jaundice</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-8">
  <h4>Many babies develop jaundice (a yellow discoloration of the skin during the first few days of life). In many babies, this jaundice does not cause a problem and is a normal part of the body’s maturation. However, sometimes the jaundice is severe because of underlying issues such as blood group incompatibility, prematurity, or other concerns. The bilirubin in the blood (the substance that causes the yellow color) can cross into the brain and is toxic to certain brain cells causing brain injury that could result in CP. If a baby is developing jaundice, the babies clinician will monitor it and, if it’s rising to a dangerous range, treat it by exposing the baby’s skin to special lights (“phototherapy”), insuring good hydration and in severe cases, performing an “exchange blood transfusion.”</h4>
